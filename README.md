# A-Shop

This project has been developed using Vite and React.
The goal was to create a React app  with two main components :
 - an ADMIN component to list and administrate products (add, edit or delete)
 - an PRODUCTS component to showcase a list of products.

I adapted the provided Angular kit as best as possible, to use with React.

Used also in this project : Primereact, PrimeFlex, PrimeIcons, axios, sass
As Backend : NodeJs + ExpressJs
